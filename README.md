# Project-2_Cosmology


This repository contains programs that will help us computing the abundance of the lightest elements in the very early Universe. Here I will go through each of them briefly.

First, we have the file "Section_c.py" where we have calculated the value of Î©_r0.

Then, with the files "Section_f.py", "Section_h.py" and "Section_i.py" we produce all the plots stored in the folder "Plots". We produce "Figure 1.pdf" with the first of the mentioned python files, "Figure 2.py" with the second one and "Figure 3.py" with the third one.

For executing the .py files in your terminal, you just have to write (in the case of, for example, the first one):

Run: python3 Section_c.py
